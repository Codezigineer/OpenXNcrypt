# OpenXNcrypt

The most best hashing function/algorithim, it's 8192-bit. It's very Quantum-proof. It's better than AES. There are no cracks, but it takes a loooong time to generate the hashed data.
Use this when you need the best encrypting, it's secure because keys come from a QRNG. This is one-way, so be careful when you lose data and try using this.
